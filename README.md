# ShadySheets
A Sample collection of maths worksheets, involving calculations and shading...
Each pdf is a collection of 30 or 40 worksheets on a particular topic area in maths.  Within each maths topic area each worksheet, although on the same topic, has been randomly generate.  So if you are thinking how does anyone mark 30+ worksheets on the same topic, but each worksheet having diffirent questions, well the answer is a bit shady!  Each individual worksheet has 20 randomly created questions (same topic as other worksheets just different number in the questions), and below the questions there is a grid with 40 potential answers; 20 correct answers to match the 20 questions and 20 non-correct answers.  Once a student has shaded in their 20 answers the worksheet can be quickly marked by comparing their shaded pattern with the answer shaded patterns held by the teacher.  

The pdfs containing 40 worksheets take this idea further by ensuring that the 20 answers are placed in the grid so that when shaded in they make 1 of ten recognisable patterns, again only know to the teacher.

All generated with excel formulae and VBA.
